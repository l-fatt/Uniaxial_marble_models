This is a repository of input files used to simulate uniaxial compression experiments on marble with pre-cut fractures based on the experiments of Yang et al., 2009. The results of these simulations are presented in Fattaruso, Cooke, and McBeck (2022) submitted to Frontiers in Earth Science, currently in review.

These simulations were performed using the work optimization code GROW created by Jessica McBeck and Michele Cooke, which calls the 2D boundary element method code Fric2D to simulate linear elastic fault mechanics. This work was funded by the National Science Foundation EAR-1650368.
